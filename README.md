# Pity Simulator ZZZ

A simulator to calculate the average number of pulls required to obtain 6 copies of a S character in gacha systems like **Zenless Zone Zero (ZZZ)**. This project includes two independent simulators:

- A **generic** pity system (soft + hard pity, with 50/50 rules).
- An **official-like** version based on ZZZ's public/probable pull rates.

Made for data nerds, gacha addicts, and curious developers.

- Soft pity ramps up starting from 75 pulls to 100% at 90.
- 50/50 rule enforced (with banner guarantee on loss).
- Targets 6 total copies of the featured unit.
